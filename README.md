## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project serves to proof some guesses that we can make from common sense when we use services for renting apartments/houses. Particularly, I wanted to find answers to following questions:
1) How significantly price depends on the season (month) of the rent.
2) What are the most and the least spread characteristics of the apartments.
3) Whether the length of description affect the chances to rent out the property
4) What features (characteristics of the apartments) gives the most significant effect on the price of the apartments.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

For the purposes of the analysis I have created 4 separate Jupyter notebooks: each for separate question stated in Motivation part.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

All the results of my analysis are presented in the text provided in the notebooks

## Licensing

Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
